# POLLANYTHING
## A social media website for users to ask random questions, and answer random questions

### Why this is distinct and complex:
1. Login, Logout, Registration
2. Asynchronous rendering of questions, and polling results, once user has answered a question
3. Search: Users can view their own (and others') questions and answers, and follow their activity!
4. Score system: Keep track of how active users are
5. Mobile responsiveness: Built with bootstrap
6. Admin Interface: For administrators to delete abusive and hate-related questions. 
7. It is styled much better.....
